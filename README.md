# react-nd-udaci-cards
The UdaciCards project is a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards.  The app is built using React-Native. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
